        <h2>Why am I interested in this career</h2>

        <p>My dad is the main reason that I chose a career in software development. When I was growing up I always saw him working on his computer coding for hours, which made me want to code for two reasons. The first being that he was my dad and so whatever he did seemed cool but the second reason is the reason that I'm still coding. The second reason is that I like how I could do anything I wanted with the code. I could make an informational website about a topic I find interesting, I could turn an idea into a game. I could do anything I wanted which interested me as a kid and still does.</p>

        <h2>10 Year Journey to Becoming a Software Developer</h2>

        <p>First year after high school: You applied to a college your senior year and got accepted so you decide to move out immediately to start college. You sign up for multiple tech related classes such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Robotics, and a couple math classes just to be sure. Second year: You passed your classes and have learned so much more about coding. You sign up for more coding classes but on the side you start to do little coding gigs to make a little money. Third year: You keep on your way to a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering and Mathematics. You have made a couple hundred dollars from side gigs and send an application to a coding company like Google or Meta. Fourth year: This is your final year on your way to get a degree in Software Engineering. You got an interview at the company you applied to and it went well. They are considering you for a position as an amateur software developer in the company. Fifth year: You passed all of your classes and recieve a bachelors degree in Software Engineering! The company you interviewed with has hired you as an amateur software developer and have started working on a minor project with a team. Sixth year: You get promoted to a bigger role on a major project which has good pay. You salary is about 190k right now and you are living comfortably in a house by yourself. Years 7-36: You continue on your journey for another 29 years slowly climbing up the ranks and earning loads of money. Eventually you get married and have kids which thanks to your job as a developer you can spend time with your kids and wife. You decline multiple promotions to a project manager where you don't get to code as much. You would much rather code yourself than boss people on how to do it. After working at this company for nearly 38 years you decide to retire at 60. After 38 years of coding you have amassed about $150,000 in savings and can live the rest of your life well. Year 37: You keep coding in your free time because you love it so much and from time to time you will do gigs like you did when you were in college. Year 38: You eventually die at the age of 95. Your family lives the rest of their life comfortably because of your wealth.</p>
